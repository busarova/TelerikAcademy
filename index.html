                <h1>A Drop of Scrumptious History</h1>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        One could hardly imagine that something so simple can be so delicious. Even a person armed with a rich English vocabulary
                        would be challenged to describe it. Delectable, lip-smacking, toothsome, appetising – lyutenitsa
                        is all of that and even more.
                        <br>Lyutenitsa, ljutenica, or lutenica (Bulgarian: лютеница) can be described as a vegetable relish,
                        paste, spread, or chutney. It can be consumed as a snack food or as an appetiser on toast, crisp
                        bread, or crackers. It is also eaten with different kinds of meat, kebapcheta, or meatballs. The
                        ingredients of lyutenitsa may vary by region but generally, it is composed of (bell) peppers, tomatoes,
                        onion, garlic, vegetable oil, and condiments such as sugar, salt, and black pepper.
                        <br> When August meets September and when the sun has become less scorching, it is time to prepare the
                        winter supplies. One of the most important home-made products in Bulgaria is lyutenitsa. The tradition
                        of its making can be traced back to the last century. Lyutenitsa, which is prepared only with natural
                        products, is not only delicious but also carries with it the nostalgia attributed to the end of the
                        summer. It reminds of a rural fireplace and the comfort of a home. There is nothing compared to spreading
                        freshly made lyutenitsa on a warm slice of bread. Home-made lyutenitsa is a unique Bulgarian product
                        and is considered one of the country’s national symbols, at least in the culinary sphere. Gastronomic
                        peculiarities in different cuisines almost always reveal contrasts in the mentality of individual
                        nations. Lyutenitsa is not only an appetiser or a side dish. It is an essential part of the Bulgarian
                        mentality – coarse homemade lyutenitsa is something sustainable, primordial. In times of crisis,
                        there is nothing more uplifting than opening a jar of home-made lyutenitsa. The word lyutenitsa calls
                        in many people’s minds the images of plump housewives who, in late September, wander around smouldering
                        fires and frequently stir the red mixture with wooden spoons, while discussing the new TV shows.
                        Three decades ago, this picture could be observed in the early autumn not only in villages but also
                        in districts of major cities. Boiling the red relish bore an essential part of the specific atmosphere
                        of the moderate wellbeing of the 70s and 80s. At the time, the stores were selling only one kind
                        of lyutenitsa – “Horo”.

                    <i>
                        In its familiar form, lyutenitsa appeared during the economic crisis in the first decades of the last century. Around 1930,
                        Bulgaria embarked upon an intensive production of tomatoes and red peppers for the canning industry
                        – both for domestic consumption and for export. During the Second World War, the government started
                        producing lyutenitsa en masse and, as a result, it quickly gained popularity.
                        <br> Industrial production began in the early 50s of the 20th century. The Bulgarian State Standard for
                        lyutenitsa appeared soon after that. It stipulated that the relish should be made only with tomato
                        and pepper paste, onion, salt, sugar, and oil. The release of this standard and the presence of industrial
                        technology made lyutenitsa a product for mass consumption.
                        <br>The stores nowadays also offer the distant cousins of lyutenitsa – Pinjur, Ajvar, and Kyopolou. They
                        are part of the culinary traditions of other Balkan countries – Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey – but their
                        composition, method of preparation, and taste cannot be compared to the Bulgarian chutney.

                <h1>Stupefying Health Benefits of Lyutenitsa</h1>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        There is a general belief among Bulgarians that lyutenitsa, in its classic unadulterated form, has a very high health index
                        with nutritional and dietary properties. Many of the elements therein are essential for the proper
                        development, maintenance and restoration of the human body.
                        <br> The fruit sugars, acids, vitamins, mineral salts, trace elements, and other substances, found in
                        the relish, are easily digested and are a great source of energy. It is also believed to help metabolism
                        and to lead harmful substances out of the body. Lyutenitsa’s main health benefits can be found in
                        the tomato lycopene, which increases its amount when tomatoes are processed – that is how the relish
                        is made. Lycopene is a non-provitamin A carotenoid that can be blamed for the red/pink colours of
                        tomatoes, pink grapefruit, and other foods. Studies suggest that the consumption of foods, containing
                        lycopene, may be beneficial for the treatment of cancer or cardiovascular disease.
